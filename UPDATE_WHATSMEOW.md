# Updating the whatsmeow Library

You're encountering the `Client outdated (405) connect failure` error because the WhatsApp Web protocol has been updated, but the current version of the whatsmeow library in your project is outdated.

## Current Version

Your project is using:
```
go.mau.fi/whatsmeow v0.0.0-20230427180258-7f679583b39b (April 2023)
```

## How to Update

1. Go to your project directory:
   ```
   cd D:/Dev/go-simple-whatsapp-gateway2
   ```

2. Update the whatsmeow library:
   ```
   go get -u go.mau.fi/whatsmeow@latest
   ```

3. Update all dependencies:
   ```
   go mod tidy
   ```

4. Rebuild your application:
   ```
   go build
   ```

## Alternative Workaround

If you can't update the library immediately, you can try the following workaround:

1. Delete the whatsapp-data directory to remove any existing sessions:
   ```
   rm -rf ./whatsapp-data
   ```

2. Create your clients again and try to connect - sometimes this works with older library versions

## Compatibility Issues to Watch For

When updating the whatsmeow library, keep an eye out for:

1. Changes to the QR code generation API
2. Changes to the message sending API
3. Changes to event handling

You might need to make small adjustments to your code if the library's API has changed significantly.

## Long-term Solution

The best long-term solution is to:

1. Update whatsmeow regularly
2. Subscribe to notifications for the whatsmeow repository to stay informed about updates
3. Implement a version check in your application to alert you when an update is needed
